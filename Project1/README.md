Project Name 1: Resume Screening using python: By natural language processing algorithms, we have developed a program capable of screening  resumes in few minute  to identify the best fit for a job opening based on specific criteria or scores.

The programs usually look for specific keywords; they sort resumes and rank them to determine the job applications that should be further reviewed by recruiters. While each company might have its own resume screening system, it is crucial for candidates to know how they work with the aim of improving their keywords selection based on the job opening they are applying to.
The match percentage is displayed on a bar chart, and the predicted job position for the resume is displayed.The application uses the pandas for creating dataframes, nltk for processing the content of resume and matplotlib to plot the chart.
